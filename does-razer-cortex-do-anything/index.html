<p>Razer cortex is a great free tool that can help improve performance in games, particularly if you're running titles that demand a large amount of ram. The game runs the same way even with everything on low, if i use razer cortex it runs at 120fps with everything on high. Cortex and other boosters do only software/os level stuff. It essentially frees up ram and ends some background processes.</p>
